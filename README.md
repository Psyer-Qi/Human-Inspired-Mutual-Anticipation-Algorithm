# Human-Inspired-Mutual-Anticipation-Algorithm
This project includes all data and analysis codes of human-inspired mutual anticipation algorithm

## System requirements
1. All code has been tested on Mac OS (Version 14.5) and windows (Version 11 23H2)
2. All computational modelling code was tested on Matlab R2023a
3. All data analysis and graphing code was tested with R (version 4.4.2) using RStudio (version 2024.09.1+394)
4. The Fast Marching Toolbox need to be installed (Toolbox Fast Marching: Version 1.2.0.0 by Gabriel Pyre, https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6110-toolbox-fast-marching)

## Basic requirements in the Algorithmic Simulation
The algorithmic simulations were conducted on a workstation equipped with an Intel Core i9-13900KF CPU (24 cores/32 threads), 32GB DDR5 RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. The algorithm was implemented in Python 3.11.8 under Windows 11 23H2, with key dependencies including Taichi 1.7.0 and NumPy 1.26.4.
